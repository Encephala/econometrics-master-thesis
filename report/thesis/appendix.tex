\chapter{LISS Questions for Studied Variables}
\label{chap:app:liss_questions}
The following lists the official (English) descriptions of the variables studied.
Some variables are manually derived from the asked questions rather than calculated directly, for example MHI5 score and BMI.
In this case, the derived variables are indicated in parentheses.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\chapter{Long-run Effect in ARDL Model}
\label{chap:app:long_run_effect}
Consider the following model with both autoregressive and distributed lags.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:app:ardl_model}
    y_{it} = \sum_{l=1}^{L_y} \rho_l y_{i,t-l} + \sum_{l=0}^{L_x} \beta_l x_{i,t-l} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
Controls are left out for simplicity. With controls, the following expressions would hold conditional on the
controls.
The coefficients $\beta_l$ can be interpreted as causing a shift in the equilibrium value of $y_{it}$.
In equilibrium we have
\begin{equation}
    E(y_{it}) = E(y_{i,t-1}) = y^*,
\end{equation}
and $x_{it} = x^*$. Substituting in \cref{eq:app:ardl_model}, we get
\begin{equation}
    y^* (1 - \sum_{l=1}^{L_y} \rho_l) = x^* \sum_{l=0}^{L_x} \beta_l
\end{equation}
Thus, if a binary variable $x_{it}$ changes from a stable value of  0 to 1, the equilibrium value of $y_{it}$ changes by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sum_{l=0}^{L_x} \beta_l}{1 - \sum_{l=1}^{L_y} \rho_l}
\end{equation}

TODO

This'll sure be fun, it's only 9 complete regression tables hahaaaa

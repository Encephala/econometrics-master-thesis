The LISS panel \cite{scherpenzeel2010liss} started in 2007 in the Netherlands. It takes the form of an online questionnaire
which is held yearly, on various topics such as health, religion, leisure, family, work and so on.
Its data is freely available for the purposes of research and policymaking.
Besides these studies, background variables are collected on a monthly basis, like age, household composition,
income and primary occupation.
Recruitment is done invite-only to limit self-selection, although it cannot be wholly prevented as
participation is still voluntary and motivated by a financial incentive. Additionally, some self-selection might occur
in the roughly 80\% response rate, despite efforts to contact inactive panel members. Due to a yearly attrition of 12\%,
refreshment samples were occassionally introduced, selected such as to balance representativeness of househould type,
age and ethnicity \cite{lissdata_methodology}. This also effectively introduces missing data.
The nature and impact of this missing data is further discussed in \cref{sec:data:missingness}.

The focus of this study is on two of the core studies, namely the Social Integration and Leisure study and the Health study.
The prior directly measures engagement in physical exercise by question 104, ``Do you practice sports?''.
Mental health is queried in the latter, though not as directly. Questions 11 through 15 are the five-item Mental Health Inventory
(MHI5), a standard screening questionnaire for mental health \cite{berwick1991performance}. Respondents are asked how often, over the past four weeks,
they felt very anxious; so down that nothing could cheer them up; calm and peaceful; depressed and gloomy; and happy.
Responses are measured on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from ``never'' to ``continuously'', and the scores are combined
linearly to create the MHI5 score from 0 to 100 with increments of 4, where a higher score indicates superior mental health.
Refer to \cref{chap:app:liss_questions} for the exact formulation of the questions asked for all of the variables studied,
including the controls and mediators that as selected in \cref{sec:modelling:regressors}.

\section{Quality Issues}
\label{sec:data:quality}
Beyond the problem of self-selection as already discussed, there are more issues that plague the studied data.
Naturally, all the information is self-reported. This can lead to noise in the data, as for instance the difference
between ``sometimes'' and ``often'' in the MHI5 screening can be subjective. Furthermore, \citeA{brown2018mental} find that
mental health is typically overreported, leading to a bias towards zero when estimating the effect of an intervention.
Self-reporting bias in general is a well-established phenomenon \cite{rosenman2011measuring}, but in practice it is a
necessary price to pay when gathering data at such a large scale. The large sample size of the LISS panel might
help to preserve statistical power in the face of the increased variance, but the resulting bias cannot be overcome
without explicitly modelling the bias-inducing effect, which is beyond the scope of this study.

Another risk factor for poor data quality is the extensiveness of the questionnaire. The total yearly LISS study
comprises multiple thousands of questions, and it is likely that this causes respondents to not answer each question
with as much care as they would on a shorter questionnaire, and perhaps even more significantly, it might lead to
failure to respond in the first place.
To combat this, the core studies are held at different times of year. The Health study is (almost) always held in November
through December, whereas the Leisure study was held in February through March before 2015, and October through November since.
The effect of questionnaire length has been studied in the literature, with somewhat conflicting results. \citeA{galesic2009effects} for instance
find worse reponse quality for questions later in the survey as compared to earlier. On the other hand, \citeA{andreadis2020impact,subar2001shorter}
do not find significant evidence for improved response rate and data quality with shorter questionnaires. The latter
also note ease of administration may compensate for length, in which regard the online nature and typically multiple-choice
questions of the panel do well. The impact of the length of the panel is thus likely not a major concern.

A worthwhile consideration is the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the data. The negative effect of the pandemic on public
mental health has been the topic of much discussion \cite{cullen2020mental,kumar2021covid} and has been empirically verified \cite{kupcova2023effects}.
Additionally, due to closing of public facilites, people engaged in exercise significantly less \cite{amini2021covid}.
The pandemic thus seems a priori to be a significant risk factor for endogeneity in the present analysis.
However, curiously, neither the effect of the pandemic on mental health nor its effect on rates of physical exercise
seem to be present in the data. As \cref{fig:data:sample_moments_y_x} shows, sample statistics of both variables
vary little over time with no appreciably change after the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020.
This puts the validity of the data into question, as these findings conflict with the literature on this topic.
The constance in sports engagement may be explained by the fact that while sports facilities closed, people had more spare time
as for instance social events and commuting were no longer possible, which appears to compensate for the effect of
closing sports facilities.
However, the lack of decrease in mental health is quite remarkable. It is perhaps an artefact of biases introduced
due to self-reported data, as people may have measured their state relative that of people around them, rather than
relative to themselves previously.
Regardless, based on the lack of impact on the sample statistics, the Covid pandemic will not be of further consideration
for this work.
